//Need to add more hours/timeblocks for input in your HTML

//Functionality for the SaveButton
//Add event listener, need to be able to store and remove user input from local storage.

//Create some sort of Timer Function
  //loop through each time block...based upon current time it will know if it is past, present, or future

//On page reload or refresh...any input in local storage needs to be rendered to the correct hour.
